- Analyzing the Cordoba Mosque, Parthenon, and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Amiens)

#### Cordoba Mosque

- Very complicated water retention system so people could wash before going to the mosque and retaining water for the green area
- [<u>Context</u>] Prior to the mosque, it was the Visigothic Church of St. Vincent (6th century) $\rightarrow$ construction begins on $785-786$ C.E. 
- [<u>Floorplan</u>] 
  - (1) Wall separating the courtyard from the prayer area 
  - (2) columns are lined in "aisles" in the prayer area
  - (3) Side opposite from the courtyard is the qibla wall, directing prayer direction
- [<u>Arches</u>] Horseshoe arches (lower layer arches curl in more, do not just end at diameter)
  - Arches rest on top of capital + columns made of stone, pre-existing columns that get reused for the mosque
  - Top layer of round arches above "piers" (mini columns that stack on the other base columns)
- [<u>Expansion</u>] Series of expansions that correspond with certain rulers
  - Prayer Hall Addition: (836 CE) $\rightarrow$ extension of the qibla wall where they extended the prayer space
  - Western Portal, Vizier's Gate: (855 CE) $\rightarrow$ embellished and restored, add a horseshoe arch for design, not structural 
    - Important entrance that would have been used by the emir, other figures - opens to the palace lobby
  - Maqsura and Mihrab: (961-976) $\rightarrow$ extending the building even further and adding more portals inspired by the Vizier's Gate
    - Mihrab: Niche that marks the direction for prayer
      - Carved stone, mosaic (with gold), painted pieces of glass
      - Inscriptions $\rightarrow$ from the Qur'an 59:23
    - Maqsura: 3 domes that are elaborately decorated that create a space, exclusive space that not everyone had access to $\rightarrow$ higher dignitaries / rulers / religious officials could be in that space!
      - Visually looks like an octagon, natural light comes in through bay windows under the dome
  - Building Cathedral Church in Prayer Hall (inserted a late-gothic Cathedral into the mosque)
