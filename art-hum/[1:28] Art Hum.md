### Parthenon

#### The Architecture

- "Optical refinements" $\rightarrow$ things that you notice about the building after someone mentions it!
  - <u>Entasis</u>: the slight convexity in the taper of the columns
  - <u>Inclination</u>: the columns incline/tilt inwards and taper in a gradual curve, not in a straight line (they will intersect if you extend toward infinity)
  - <u>Curvature</u>: all horizontal lines are slightly curved; none are straight
  - Posts, Lintels (like Stone Henge) $\rightarrow$ specialized marble was imported to use this
- Why do these optical refinements?
  - Athena is higher than everything else, at the peak of the curved floor
  - Some people think that the building is "perched", it becomes slightly more active with the curvature
- The "Classical" Style $\rightarrow$ thought of as the 5th century B.C.E
  - Two main stylistic systems of Greek buildings: Doric, Ionic $\rightarrow$ kind of like different languages for building a temple (Parthenon is Doric with Ionic integrated into it!)
    - Doric: gestures to older wooden styles, petiment, metopes + triglyphs
    - Ionic: has base to the column, much more decorative capital, frieze on the inner layer
  - (Met, Low Library, Butler) $\rightarrow$ secular, but still connected to some sort of prestige
- Ancient Sculpture "categories" $\rightarrow$ shifts in style that are noticed post-shift
  - Archaic: New York Kouros, abstract/hieraatic, idealism: essence over reality
  - Classical: Dorphoros, idealized naturalism: perfected reality
  - Hellenistic: Laoco√∂n
- Comparing the categories 
  - Archaic vs Classical $\rightarrow$ Archaic sculpture seems generalized (more abstract), Classical seems like a specific person (idealized as natural / organic), classical has more movement than the archaic one
    - Maybe the Archaic style can be described as "consistent" - pose is showing strength and power in the rigidity of the position (consistency is power?)
- Abstraction vs Naturalism $\rightarrow$ we see statutes enlivened by the body mechanics of an actual human body, there's a move toward naturalism!
- The transformation of the temple
  - Church $\rightarrow$ gunpowder storage $\rightarrow$ mosque
