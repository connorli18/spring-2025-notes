### The Parthenon Unit (447 - 432 B.C.)

- Core Works

  - The Parthenon (447 - 432 B.C.)

  - Pediments (438 - 432 B.C.)

  - Metopes (440 B.C.)

  - Frieze (442 - 438 B.C., as late as 432 B.C.)

- Morningside Heights
  - Lots of parallels between Acropolis (Parthenon) and the Morningside Heights area
    - Natural "height" $\rightarrow$ on a natural rock upward
    - Fortification walls (to reinforce height "overlooking" the city)
    - Propylaia (the pathway to approach the Parthenon - only one space to enter)
      - Narrow entrance (paralleled to 116th & Amsterdam), you can't tell where you are headed until the "moment" where it opens up and you can see the grand buildings + open space
    - Parthenon = Low Library
      - **Outside:** Columns, Inscriptions/Decorations, approach on steps to elevated platform, porch area behind columns
      -  **Inside:** Athena Parthenos = Bust of Athena (in Low Library)
    - The "use" of these spaces for events and rituals

- The Parthenon Reconstruction
  - There is a lot of color! $\rightarrow$ the aesthetic quality is different from our percception of "uncarved marble"
- Historical Context
  - Athenian Empire of the Delian League (it was a bunch of city states)
  - There was also an earlier version of the Parthenon (destroyed by Carthage), the decision was made to "leave the footprints" and build next to it!
  - Why did they not put the entrance to the Parthenon in the front near the Propylaia?
- Building Analysis
  - Floorplan 
    - Two rows of columns $\rightarrow$ Cella/nos (main atrium) $\rightarrow$ Athena $\rightarrow$ Wall to separate the "temple" part from the "treasury"
  - Sculptural Program (Pheidias)
    - Pediments (sculptures that filled the triangle at the top)
    - Metopes (a banner of scultures wrapping around the bottom of the triangles)
    - Frieze (inner layer sculptures)
  - Why do you work with marble when it's so hard to use? 
    - Lots of choices that are made thinking about the divine, sculpture is an offering to the gods
- The Metopes (4 different themes) $\rightarrow$ battles of people/groups that have threatened Athenian ancestors (battled + won) at some point in their history
  - Trojan War
  - Amazonomachy
  - Centauromachy: fighting the centaurs 
  - Gigantomachy
