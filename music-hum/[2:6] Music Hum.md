# [2/6] Music Hum

#### [Opera] Orpheus

- Vocal section and instrumental switch back and forth (the dancing only happens during the instrumental)
  - **Ritornello**: "little return," taken from the madrigal tradition
  - **Lament**: the abandonment of logic and rationality in the face of released emotion

#### Barbara Strozzi

- Maybe the only woman member (and female composer) of the Venice Academy (Camerate) $\rightarrow$ intellectual, musical center 
- She may have been a courtesan $\rightarrow$ not a prostitute in a formal sense
- Only wrote secular music, called **cantatas** (single voice, with accompaniment)
- **Lament**: a common musical structure, more formalized form (post-Monteverdi)
